**Account Management System
**


This Python project defines an Account class for managing a simple bank account. It supports basic operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking an account balance. This can be expanded and customized to simulate a basic banking environment.

**Features
**

Account Creation: Create a new account by specifying an account number, initial balance, and account holder's name.
Deposit Money: Increase the account balance by a specified deposit amount.
Withdraw Money: Decrease the account balance by a specified withdrawal amount, if sufficient funds are available.
Check Balance: Display the current account balance for the account holder.
Class Definition

**The Account class has the following methods:
**

__init__: Initializes an account with the account number, starting balance, and account holder's name.
deposit: Prompts the user to input an amount to deposit, adds it to the current balance, and confirms the updated balance.
withdraw: Prompts the user to input an amount to withdraw, deducts it if sufficient funds are available, and confirms the updated balance.
check_balance: Displays the current balance for the account holder.
Dependencies

**Add error handling for non-numeric inputs during deposit/withdraw operations.
**

Implement account-specific PIN verification for enhanced security.
Track transaction history for each account.
This README should give users and developers a clear understanding of how to use and extend the Account class. Let me know if youâ€™d like to add more details or further enhancements!
